Maze runner

Previous 135 project where we have a maze and the guy will need tools to escape it. We will animate and reformat the previous 135 project where we had to pick apples and chop trees
a similar concept will be aplied in the sense that a person will need to find his way out of the maze simotaunausly running away from zombies and clearning his path away from 
obsticles he sees on his path."
